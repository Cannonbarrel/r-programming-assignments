When I tested : 

ssignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)
> myMean <- function(assignment2) {
+   return(sum(assignment) / length(someData)) 
 
I got nothing that printed, and no error popped up. 

Though there was no error, the function did not succeed in printing the mean for the list of variables. 

To correct this, you have to change "assignment" and "someData" to assignment2 so it knows to use the variables from that vector. 

This is what the finished code should look like: 



> assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)
> myMean <- function(assignment2) {
+   return(sum(assignment2) / length(assignment2))
+ }  
> myMean(assignment2)
[1] 19.25
>
